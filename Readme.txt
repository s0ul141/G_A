Genetic Algorithm
------------------
This is a project which detects and predicts the attacks on network traffic data, here we have used the NLKDD data set for training the model and testing it .
We have compaired multiple classifiers DT, SVM, RM and KNN with our Genetic_algorithm + DT.

All the results are given in the documentation please check it out.
